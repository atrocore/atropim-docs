# Associated Products

**Associated Products** – two products, which are related within a certain association. So there is a *main product* and a *related product*. Related products are not automatically cross-linked, so if product A (main product) is related to product B (associated product), it does not mean that product B is automatically related to product A. 

The option to create associated products targets on increasing sales and helping in promotion and marketing of new products, but has a slightly different configuration process.

AtroPIM comes with the following predefined associations:

- **Up-sell products** are the products with higher price and quality, which could be more popular with shoppers and more profitable for the sellers. Up-sell products are generally packed with special features or other competitive advantages to encourage customers to change their mind and buy these ones. 

- **Cross-sell products** are complementary products, which could be bought in addition to the main one. Good examples are cases or smartphone covers that can be offered to a shopper, who is buying a smartphone. These are the products the customer would probably also look for.

- **Related products** are usually products of the same category and type as the selected product or service. These are competitive alternatives to provide the customer with a wide number of options in addition to the main product. Sometimes related products are useful for promotion of less popular products or for attracting customers' attention to possible alternatives.

## Associated Product Fields

The `Associated Product` entity record comes with the following preconfigured fields; mandatory are marked with *:

| **Field Name**           | **Description**                   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Association *            | Association name within which the products are related           |
| Both directions          | Association direction type of the record: one- or two-way      |
| Backward association * *(if `Both directions` is enabled)*   | Backward association name         |

## Creating

To create a new associated product record, click `Associated Products` in the navigation menu to get to the associated products [list view](#listing), and then click the `Create Associated Product` button. The common creation  pop-up will appear:

![Associated product creation](../../_assets/associated-products/ap-create-popup.jpg)

Here fill in all the required fields for the entry being created. Select the `Both directions` checkbox to make the association **two-way** – when product A is associated with product B; and vice versa, product B is associated with product A. Leave this checkbox unselected to make the association **one-way** – when product A is associated with product B, but not vice versa.

*If a [backward association](./associations.md) is defined for the association entry within which the products are related, the `Both directions` checkbox will be selected by default with the backward association name displayed in the corresponding field.*

Alternatively, use `+` button on the `ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS` panel of the [product](./products.md#associated-products) detail view page or the [quick create](./user-interface.md#quick-create) button on any AtroPIM page and fill in the required fields in the associated product creation pop-up that appears. Please, note that the `ASSOCIATED PRODUCTS` panel of the product [detail view](./views-and-panels.md#detail-view) page displays which products are in relation with the currently opened product and within which association.
