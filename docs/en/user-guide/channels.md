# Channels

**Channel** – a destination point for your product data, which can be synced with third-party systems as well as exported in certain formats. Generally, a channel is a place, where your product information should appear; for example, your online shop, mobile app or print catalog.

Using channels allows you to implement your multichannel or omni-channel strategy in a more efficient way.
