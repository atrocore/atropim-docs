# Brands

**Brand** â€“ a name, term, design, symbol, or other feature that distinguishes the product from its rivals in the eyes of the customer. Brands are used in business, marketing and advertising to increase sales. 

By default, only one brand can be assigned to the product. Brand is optional for the product. It is technically possible to have different brands with same name, because of different IDs that would be assigned to them.

Brands can be activated or deactivated. Deactivated brands cannot be used in the system and are not transferred via any channel.

## Brand Fields

The brand entity comes with the following preconfigured fields; mandatory are marked with *:

| **Field Name**           | **Description**                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Active                   | Activity state of the brand record         |
| Name (multi-lang) *      | Name of the brand (e.g. Apple, Nike, etc.) |
| Code *                   | Unique value used to identify the brand. It can only consist of lowercase letters, digits and underscore symbols     |
| Description (multi-lang) | Description of the brand usage                   |

If you want to make changes to the brand entity, e.g. add new fields, or modify brand views, please contact your administrator.
