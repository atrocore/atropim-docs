# Products

**Product** – the item in physical, virtual or cyber form as well as a service offered for sale. Every product is made at a cost and sold at a price. 

There are several [types](#product-types) of products in the AtroPIM system, and each product, irregardless of its type, can be assigned to a certain [product family](./product-families.md), which will define the attributes to be set for this product. A product can be assigned to several [categories](./categories.md), be of a certain [brand](./brands.md), described in several languages and be prepared for selling via different [channels](./channels.md). A product can be in [association](./associations.md) of certain type with some other product, and thus within different associations and with different products. It is possible to set different [attribute](./attributes.md) values for different channels and upload product images.

## Product Fields

The product entity comes with the following preconfigured fields; mandatory are marked with *:

| **Field Name**           | **Description**                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Name *			       | Product name								|
| SKU *				       | Unique identifier of the product that can be used only once within the same catalog												  |
| Type *			       | Product type that defines the product nature  |
| Catalog *				   | The name of the catalog to which the product belongs        |
| Product family *		   | The name of the product family, within which the product is created				|

If you want to make changes to the product entity, e.g. add new fields, or modify product  views, please, contact your administrator.

## Product Types

The only type of products available in the AtroPIM system by default is **Simple Product** – a standalone physical item or service sold as one piece. 

The list of products may be extended along with the installation of additional modules to your system. To learn more about available modules and their features, please, visit our [store](https://atropim.com/store). 

After the "Product Variants" module is installed to your system, the following product types are added:

- **Configurable Product** – a product with different variants that has multiple options for each variation. Each possible combination of options represents a separate, simple product, which makes it possible to track inventory for each of them. This product type creates for the user endless flexibility in product configuration.

- **Product variant** – basically a product with a complete set of its properties.

*Please, visit our [store](https://atropim.com/store/product-variants) to learn more about the **"Product Variants"** module and its features.*

In order to add custom types of products, please, contact your developer.

![Products single record actions](../../_assets/products/products-single-actions.jpg)

For details on these actions, please, refer to the [**Single Record Actions**](./views-and-panels.md#single-record-actions) section of the **Views and Panels** article in this user guide.

## Search and Filtering Types

Product records can be searched and filtered according to your needs on their list/plate view page. For details on the search and filtering options, refer to the [**Search and Filtering**](./search-and-filtering.md) article in this user guide.

Besides the standard field filtering, two other types – [by attributes](#by-attributes) and [by categories](#by-categories) – are available for product records.

### By Attributes

Filtering by attributes is performed on the basis of attribute values of the attributes that are linked to products:

![Attribute filters](../../_assets/products/attribute-filters.jpg)

For details on this type of filtering, please, refer to the [**Custom Attribute Filters**](./search-and-filtering.md#custom-attribute-filters) section within the **Search and Filtering** article in this user guide.

### By Categories

To search product records by categories, enter the desired category name into the corresponding search field or use the auto-fill functionality:

![Search by category](../../_assets/products/search-by-category.jpg)

As a result, the defined category will be highlighted in the catalog tree, and only products belonging to this category will be displayed in the product records list. 

## Editing

To edit the product, click the `Edit` button on the [detail view](./views-and-panels.md#detail-view) page of the currently open product record; the following editing window will open:

![Product editing](../../_assets/products/products-edit.jpg)

Here edit the desired fields and click the `Save` button to apply your changes.

Please, note that by default, deactivating a product record has no impact on the records of associated products.

Besides, you can make changes in the product record via [in-line editing](./views-and-panels.md#in-line-editing) on its detail view page.

Alternatively, make changes to the desired product record in the [quick edit](./views-and-panels.md#quick-edit-view) pop-up that appears when you select the `Edit` option from the single record actions menu on the products list/plate view page:

![Editing pop-up](../../_assets/products/product-editing-popup.jpg)

## Removing

To remove the product record, use the `Remove` option from the actions menu on its detail view page

![Remove1](../../_assets/products/remove-details.jpg)

or from the single record actions menu on the products list/plate view page:

![Remove2](../../_assets/products/remove-list.jpg)

## Duplicating

Use the `Duplicate` option from the actions menu to go to the product creation page and get all the values of the last chosen product record copied in the empty fields of the new product record to be created. Modifying the SKU value is required, as this value has to be unique within the catalog.

## Working With Entities Related to Products

In the AtroPIM system, the following entities are related to products:
- [attributes](#product-attributes);
- [categories](#product-categories);
- [channels](#channels);
- [associated products](#associated-products);
- [images](#images).

They all are displayed on the corresponding panels on the product record [detail view](./views-and-panels.md#detail-view) page. If any panel is missing, please, contact your administrator as to your access rights configuration.

To be able to relate more entities to products, please, contact your administrator.

### Product Attributes

**Product attributes** are characteristics of a certain product that make it distinct from other products, e.g. size, color. Product attributes are to be used as [filters](#by-attributes).

Product attribute values are predefined by the [attributes](./attributes.md) assigned to the [product family](./product-families.md) to which the given product belongs.

Product attribute records are displayed on the `PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES` panel within the product record [detail view](./views-and-panels.md#detail-view) page and are grouped by attribute groups. Product attributes data is shown in the following table columns:
 - Attribute
 - Value
 - Is required
 - Scope
 - Channels

![Product attributes panel](../../_assets/products/product-attributes-panel.jpg)

It is possible to add custom attributes to a product record, without previously linking them to the product family of the product by selecting the existing ones or creating new attributes. 

To create new attribute records to be linked to the currently open product, click the `+` button located in the upper right corner of the `PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES` panel:

![Creating attributes](../../_assets/products/attribute-create.jpg)

In the attribute value creation pop-up that appears, select the attribute record from the list of the existing ones and configure its parameters. By default, the defined attribute record has the `Global` scope, but you can change it to `Channel` and select the desired channel (or channels) in the added field:

![Channel attribute](../../_assets/products/attribute-channel.jpg)

Click the `Save` button to complete the product attribute creation process or `Cancel` to abort it.

Please, note that you can link the same attribute to the product record more than once, but with different scopes (`Global` / `Channel`), and same channel can be used only once:

![Attribute scope](../../_assets/products/attribute-scope.jpg)

Use the `Select` option from the actions menu located in the upper right corner of the `PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES` panel to link the already existing attributes to the currently open product record:

![Adding attributes](../../_assets/products/attributes-select.jpg)

In the "Attributes" pop-up that appears, choose the desired attribute (or attributes) from the list and press the `Select` button to link the item(s) to the product record. The linked attributes have the `Global` scope by default.

AtroPIM supports linking to products not only separate attributes, but also [attribute groups](./attribute-groups.md). For this, use the `Select Attribute Group` option from the actions menu, and in the "Attribute Groups" pop-up that appears, select the desired groups from the list of available attribute group records.

Please, note that attributes linked to products are arranged by attribute groups correspondingly. Their placement depends on the configuration and sort order value of the attribute group to which they belong.

Attribute records linked to the given product can be viewed, edited, or removed via the corresponding options from the single record actions menu on the `PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES` panel:

![Attributes actions](../../_assets/products/attributes-actions-menu.jpg)

The attribute record is removed from the product only after the action is confirmed:

![Removal confirmation](../../_assets/product-families/attribute-remove-confirmation.jpg)

Please, note that only custom attribute records can be removed, but for the ones that are linked to the product via the product family there is no such option in the single record actions menu. 

### Product Categories

[Categories](./categories.md) that are linked to the product record are shown on the `PRODUCT CATEGORIES` panel within the product [detail view](./views-and-panels.md#detail-view) page and include the following table columns:
 - Category
 - Scope
 - Channels

![Product categories panel](../../_assets/products/product-categories-panel.jpg)

It is possible to link categories to a product by selecting the existing ones or creating new categories. 

To create new categories to be linked to the currently open product, click the `+` button on the `PRODUCT CATEGORIES` panel and enter the necessary data in the category creation pop-up that appears:

![Creating categories](../../_assets/products/create-product-category.jpg)

By default, the defined category has the `Global` scope, but you can change it to `Channel` and select the desired channel (or channels) in the added field:

![Channel category](../../_assets/products/category-channel.jpg)

Click the `Save` button to complete the category creation process or `Cancel` to abort it.

Please, note that you can link the same category to the product twice, but with different scopes – `Global` or `Channel`.

To assign a category (or several categories) to the product record, use the `Select` option from the actions menu located in the upper right corner of the `PRODUCT CATEGORIES` panel:

![Adding categories](../../_assets/products/categories-select.jpg)

In the "Categories" pop-up that appears, choose the desired category (or categories) from the list and press the `Select` button to link the item(s) to the product.

Please, note that you can link both root and child categories to the product. The only condition is that their root category should be linked to the [catalog](./catalogs.md) to which the given product belongs.

Product categories can be viewed, edited, or removed via the corresponding options from the single record actions menu on the `PRODUCT CATEGORIES` panel:

![Categories actions](../../_assets/products/categories-actions-menu.jpg)

### Channels

[Channels](./channels.md) that are linked to the product are displayed on its [detail view](./views-and-panels.md#detail-view) page on the `CHANNELS` panel and include the following table columns:
- Name
- Code
- Active

![Channels panel](../../_assets/products/channels-panel.jpg)

![Adding channels](../../_assets/products/channels-select.jpg)

As soon as the channel is linked to the product, it is added to the [filtering](./search-and-filtering.md) by scopes list, located in the upper right corner of the product record [detail view](./views-and-panels.md#detail-view) page:

![Channel filter](../../_assets/products/channel-filter.jpg)

Select the desired channel in this list to filter the product record data display on the `PRODUCT ATTRIBUTES`, `PRODUCT CATEGORIES`, and `IMAGES` panels by the defined channel.

Channels linked to the product record can be viewed, edited, unlinked, or removed via the corresponding options from the single record actions menu on the `CHANNELS` panel:

![Channels actions](../../_assets/products/channels-actions-menu.jpg)

![Creating images](../../_assets/products/product-image-creation-popup.jpg)

The following *image uploading types* are available in the AtroPIM system by default:
- **File** / **Files** – image files that are stored locally (on your PC or other device). When the `File` type is selected on the image creation step, the desired image file is  uploaded as an attachment. To attach several image files at the same time, the `Files` type is to be defined accordingly.
- **Link** – the URL to the image file, which is stored on the external server. When this type is selected on the image creation step, the image link must be entered in the corresponding field:

	![Image URL](../../_assets/products/image-url.jpg)

By default, the defined image has the `Global` scope, but you can change it to `Channel` and select the desired channel (or channels) in the added field:

![Channel image](../../_assets/products/image-channel.jpg)

Click the `Save` button to complete the image record creation process or `Cancel` to abort it.

Please, note that once the image record is created within the product, it is displayed on the `IMAGES` panel as a common image file (irregardless of its uploading type). 

To assign an image (or several images) to the product record, use the `Select` option from the actions menu located in the upper right corner of the `IMAGES` panel:

![Adding images](../../_assets/products/images-select.jpg)
