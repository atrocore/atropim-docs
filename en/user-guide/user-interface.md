# User Interface (UI)

The user interface (UI) includes all visible elements users see and interact with while using AtroPIM. This chapter describes all the main elements of user interface, which are the same for all entities in the system, as well as gives details on how to perform common tasks or operations in the system.

> Please, make sure to contact your administrator in order to have access to a whole set of options described in this user guide. 

The following elements make up the AtroPIM user interface:

- [**Navigation Menu**](#navigation-menu) – to navigate through available entities.
- [**Taskbar**](#taskbar) – to help the user interact with the AtroPIM system in a more efficient way; additional information or actions are displayed here. 
- [**Search and Filtering Panel**](./search-and-filtering.md) – to search and filter within one entity or its related entities.

Within the AtroPIM system your information may be presented in various ways:

- [**List View**](./views-and-panels.md#list-view) – to view the lists of entity records.
- [**Plate View**](./views-and-panels.md#plate-view) – to view entity records as plates.
- [**Detail View**](./views-and-panels.md#detail-view) – to view the entity record details.
- [**Create View**](./views-and-panels.md#create-view) – to create a new entity record in the main window.
- [**Edit View**](./views-and-panels.md#edit-view) – to edit the entity record.
- [**Quick Detail View (pop-up)**](./views-and-panels.md#quick-detail-view-small-detail-view) – to view the record details in the pop-up window.
- [**Quick Edit View (pop-up)**](./views-and-panels.md#quick-edit-view) – to edit the record detail in the pop-up window.
- [**Quick Create View**](./views-and-panels.md#quick-create-view) – to create a new entity record in the pop-up window.

## Navigation Menu

The navigation menu in the default AtroPIM theme is the menu placed on the left side of your user interface. It allows you to open list views for all entities in the system.

> The navigation menu can be configured by your administrator according to your needs.

Each user can customize his/her own navigation menu in the `User Interface` section of the user ["Preferences"](#user-preferences) page:

![Navigation Menu Cfg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atrocore/atropim/master/docs/_assets/user-interface/navigation-user-cfg.jpg)

Here select the `Custom Tab List` option and add the desired tabs using the `Add` button.  You can also define the tabs order via their drag-and-drop in the tab list.

## Taskbar

Taskbar is a top panel of the AtroPIM user interface:

![Taskbar](../../_assets/user-interface/taskbar.jpg)

A taskbar consists of a [global search](#global-search) field and some functional icons that help you work and collaborate within the AtroPIM system, namely:
- [Desktop notifications](#desktop-notifications); 
- [Queue Manager](#queue-manager);
- [Quick create](#quick-create);
- [User menu](#user-menu).

### Global Search

You can [search](./search-and-filtering.md) all the records existing in the AtroPIM system using the global search functionality. Use the search form on the taskbar for it:

![Global Search](../../_assets/user-interface/global-search.jpg) 

> The list of entities available for search is configured by the administrator.

### Desktop Notifications

AtroPIM uses two types of notifications: email notifications and system notifications (desktop notifications). Generally, email and desktop notifications are configured globally, for all users.

User can receive notifications in case when:
- a record is assigned to him;
- changes are made to the record he is following.

![Desktop Notifications](../../_assets/user-interface/desktop-notifications.jpg)

To view the notification details, click `View List` in the upper right corner of the `NOTIFICATIONS` panel.

### Queue Manager

Queue Manager is opened in the pop-up window for each operation executed displaying its status and a progress circle for the currently run operation:

![Queue Manager](../../_assets/user-interface/queue-manager.jpg)

In the Queue Manager, you will see the most recent AtroPIM operations, which were executed in the background mode. Additionally, the information on the data export and import performed with the help of export / import feeds correspondingly is shown in the Queue Manager pop-up. To learn more about the ["Export Feeds"](https://atropim.com/store/export-feeds) and ["Import Feeds"](https://atropim.com/store/import-feeds) modules, please, visit our store.

To view the details of the performed operations, click `View List` in the upper right corner of the Queue Manager.

### Clear Local Cache

AtroPIM is a single page application (SPA). To improve the page loading time, it actively uses cache for content as well as for the user interface.

If you want to be sure in getting the latest information and application functions, please use the `Clear Local Cache` option from the user drop-down menu:
<!-- added this screenshot --> 
![Clear local cache option](../../_assets/user-interface/clear-local-cache-option.jpg)

## Breadcrumb Navigation

AtroPIM comes with breadcrumb navigation on each page in the system. Breadcrumb navigation is a form of a path-style clickable navigation, which links the user back to the prior website page in the overall online route. It reveals the path the user took to arrive to the given page. The `>` symbol separates out the hierarchical search order from beginning to end and may look something like:
`Home Page > Section Page > Subsection Page`.
